# Global Tech Salaries 2025

This notebook explores salary trends for various tech roles in 2025 using a global dataset.

## Why I Did This Project

As I transition into data science, I wanted to understand how factors like job title, experience level, and remote work influence tech compensation across the globe.

This project goes beyond salary figuresâ€”it's an exploration of how data can reveal patterns that shape career trajectories, workplace equity, and industry trends. It also demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis using Python and pandas

## Key Analysis:
- Salary by job title and experience level
- Comparison of remote vs on-site compensation
- Company size and salary patterns
- Salary growth from entry to mid level

## Skills Used:
- pandas: groupby, pivot_table, map, cut, string cleaning
- seaborn & matplotlib: visualization
