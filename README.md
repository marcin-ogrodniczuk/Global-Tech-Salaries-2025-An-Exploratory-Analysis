# Global Tech Salaries 2025

This notebook explores salary trends for various tech roles in 2025 using a global dataset.

## Why I Did This Project

As I transition into data science, I wanted to understand how factors like job title, experience level, and remote work influence tech compensation across the globe.

This project isn't just about pay â€” it's about using data to uncover patterns that impact career growth, equity, and workforce trends. It also serves as a demonstration of real-world data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis using Python and pandas.

## Key Analysis:
- Salary by job title and experience level
- Comparison of remote vs on-site compensation
- Company size and salary patterns
- Salary growth from entry to mid level

## Skills Used:
- pandas: groupby, pivot_table, map, cut, string cleaning
- seaborn & matplotlib: visualization
